            <h2>About</h2>
            <p> Hello, my name is Dongmin Park. I am currently studying as a backend developer at Sungkyunkwan University. I have taken courses in Operating Systems, Networking, and Computer Architecture to build a solid foundation of knowledge required for backend development. Additionally, I have studied Data Structures and Algorithms to strengthen my fundamental problem-solving skills.
                <br> Believing that diverse experiences foster innovative thinking, I have actively participated in various activities such as joining a blockchain society (skkrypto) and engaging in industry-academic collaboration projects. Moreover, I have also taken courses related to machine learning.Although I still have room for improvement, I firmly believe that I have the potential to grow. As I have always done in the past, I will continue to strive for progress and development.</p>
